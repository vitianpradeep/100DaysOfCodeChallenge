# Alice and Bob each created one problem for HackerRank. A reviewer rates the two challenges, awarding points on a scale from 1 to 100 for three categories: problem clarity, originality, and difficulty.

# The rating for Alice's challenge is the triplet a = (a[0], a[1], a[2]), and the rating for Bob's challenge is the triplet b = (b[0], b[1], b[2]).

# The task is to find their comparison points by comparing a[0] with b[0], a[1] with b[1], and a[2] with b[2].

# If a[i] > b[i], then Alice is awarded 1 point.
# If a[i] < b[i], then Bob is awarded 1 point.
# If a[i] = b[i], then neither person receives a point.
# Comparison points is the total points a person earned.

# Given a and b, determine their respective comparison points.

# Example

# a = [1, 2, 3]
# b = [3, 2, 1]
# For elements *0*, Bob is awarded a point because a[0] .
# For the equal elements a[1] and b[1], no points are earned.
# Finally, for elements 2, a[2] > b[2] so Alice receives a point.
# The return array is [1, 1] with Alice's score first and Bob's second.
