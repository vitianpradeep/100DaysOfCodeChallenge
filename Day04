Let's learn about list comprehensions! You are given three integers  and  representing the dimensions of a cuboid along with an integer . Print a list of all possible coordinates given by  on a 3D grid where the sum of  is not equal to . Here, . Please use list comprehensions rather than multiple loops, as a learning exercise.

Example




All permutations of  are:
.

Print an array of the elements that do not sum to .


Input Format

Four integers  and , each on a separate line.

Constraints

Print the list in lexicographic increasing order.

Follow Up:
if __name__ == '__main__':
    x = int(input())
    y = int(input())
    z = int(input())
    n = int(input())
    
    
ans = [[i, j, k] 
for i in range(x + 1) 
for j in range(y + 1) 
for k in range(z + 1) 
if i + j + k != n]

print(ans)
