# 100DaysOfCodeChallenge
I have started the 100 days of code challenge on my GitHub profile with a focus on Python and data science. During this challenge, I plan to cover a variety of machine learning algorithms, including: 
**Supervised Learning Algorithms:
Linear Regression
Logistic Regression
Decision Trees
Random Forests
Support Vector Machines (SVM)
Naive Bayes
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
Neural Networks
Gradient Boosting

**Unsupervised Learning Algorithms:
K-Means Clustering
Hierarchical Clustering
Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)
Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF)
t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE)

I will also be practicing a range of data scientist tasks such as data preprocessing, feature selection and extraction, model selection and evaluation, and working with text data.

Throughout the challenge, I will be sharing my progress on GitHub and documenting my journey through regular commits and updates. My goal is to improve my skills as a data scientist and gain a deeper understanding of the field of machine learning.

I am excited to embark on this challenge and look forward to learning new techniques and technologies along the way.
